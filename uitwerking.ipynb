    "The [Iffy Index of Unreliable Sources](https://iffy.news/index/#methodology) by Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) maintains a list of news sites that regularly fail fact-checks and is a widely used research tool in the field of mis/disinformation. The data contains domain names and a compilation of credibility ratings from different sources. The list is compiled by a team of researchers, accepts feedback from publishers and is continually reconsidering past ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's somewhat common for websites to have an ads.txt (Authorized Digital Sellers) URL when they generate revenue with their file. It specifies a text file that companies can host on their web servers. This file contains information about which advertisers are allowed to operate on the site. By parsing this information for news sites in the dataset we might be able to find interesting relationships between sites' credibility and their advertisements."
